Lifecycle of component:

getdata(){ fetch('url').then(data=>this.setState({prop:data})).catch()}

class A extends Component{
	constructor(props){
		super(props)
		//this.state = {}
		//this.test = this.test.bind(this);                
	}
	state={}
	//test(){  }
	test =()=>{}
}

const App = ()=>{
  return (<A data={10}/> )
}

let aObj = new A({ data: 10 })

aObj.render()


a. creation and mounting:
   i. constructor:
      gets executed only once during the lifetime of component object and called during the creation of that object
      explicitly write when you need to initialize state or need to bind member functions with current context
      NOTE: no side-effect causing code here

   ii. static getDerivedStateFromProps(newProps, previousState)
      gets executed everytime, even for the very first time (when the object is created, after constructor)
      after the first time, everytime this function will be getting executed first before any other lifecyle hooks
      purpose: to re-set the state
      return a new state (JS object) or null
      NOTE: no side-effect causing code here

   iii. render()
       gets executed for the very first time as well as everytime whenever the state of this component gets updated or parent component gets rendered
       return a new react element (primitive value/ reference types)
       NOTE: no side-effect causing code here directly

   iv. componentDidMount():
       gets executed only one time during the entire lifecycle of the component
       returns: NOTHING
       NOTE: side-effect causing code can be written to reset the state and re-render the VDOM to update already created ADOM
